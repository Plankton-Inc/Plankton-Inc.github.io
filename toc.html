<h3>Your Content</h3>

<p>You agree that Your Content must comply with our Guidelines, as updated from time to time. As Your Content is unique, you are responsible and liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.</p>

<p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>As Plankton is a public community, Your Content will be visible to other users of the App all around the world instantly - so make sure you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. As such, you agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is sent a link to the App (e.g. individuals who receive a link to a user’s profile or shared content from other Plankton Users). By uploading Your Content on Plankton, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licences to do so, and automatically grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use Your Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).</p>

<p>We may assign and/or sub-license the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.</p>

<p>We do not have any obligation to store Your Content - if it’s important, you should make a copy.</p>

<p>So that we can prevent the unconsented use of Your Content by other members or third parties outside of Plankton, you authorise us to act on your behalf with respect to such infringing and/or unauthorised uses. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, for us to send takedown notices (including, without limitation, pursuant to 17 U. S. C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices)) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of Plankton.</p>

<h3>Member Content</h3>

<p>Other members of Plankton will also share content via the App. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed via the App at the direction of the user providing the Member Content.</p>

<p>You do not have any rights in relation to other users’ Member Content, and you may only use other Plankton users’ personal information to the extent that your use of it matches Plankton's purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users’ information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, stalk or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your Account if you misuse other users’ information.</p>

<p>Member Content is subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 512(c) and/or 512(d) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998. If you have a complaint about Member Content, please see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act section below for more information.</p>

<h3>Our Content</h3>

<p>The rest of the Content on Plankton belongs to us! Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, and other intellectual property appearing on Plankton, as well as the Plankton software and database(s), are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark, data, database rights and/or other intellectual property law rights. All right, title and interest in and to Our Content remains with us at all times.</p>

<p>We grant you a non-exclusive, limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable, licence to access and use Our Content, without the right to sublicense, under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you shall not use, sell, modify, or distribute Our Content except as 
permitted by the functionality of the App;</p></li>
<li><p>you shall not use our name in metatags, keywords and/or hidden text; </p></li>
<li><p>you shall not create derivative works from Our Content or scrape, disable, 
decompile, analyse or in any way commercially exploit Our Content, in whole 
or in part, in any way; and</p></li>
<li><p>you shall use Our Content for lawful purposes only.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>We reserve all other rights.</em></p>

<p><strong>No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content.</strong></p>

<p>Since Plankton is an online community, we generally try to avoid getting in the way and therefore don’t assume any obligation to pre-screen any of Your Content or any Member Content. However, there may be times where we need to step in, and we reserve the right to review, pre-screen, refuse and/or remove any Member Content and Your Content, including content exchanged between users in direct messages.</p>

<h2>3. RESTRICTIONS ON THE APP</h2>

property laws, anti-spam laws, equal opportunity laws and regulatory requirements;</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You can report any abuse or complain about Member Content by contacting us, outlining the abuse and/or complaint. We reserve the right to investigate any possible violations of these Terms, any Plankton user’s rights, or any third party rights and we may, in our sole discretion, immediately terminate any user’s right to use of the App without prior notice, as set out further in Section 1 above, and/or remove any improper, infringing or otherwise unauthorised Member Content submitted to the App.</p>

<p>We don’t control any of the things our users say or do, so you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the App.</p>

<p><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PLANKTON LABS DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS.

<p>Scraping or replicating any part of the App without our prior consent is expressly prohibited. This includes by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces - unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with us.</p>

<h2>9. THIRD PARTY APP STORE</h2>

<p>The following additional terms and conditions apply to you if you download the App from a Third Party Store. To the extent that the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Section, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Section will apply, but solely with respect to the App and the Third Party Store. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>These Terms are concluded solely between you and Plankton Labs and not with the providers of the Third Party Store, and Plankton Labs (and not the Third Party Store providers) is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof. To the extent that these Terms provide for usage rules for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the Third Party Store from which you obtain the App, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third Party Store will take precedence and will apply.</p></li>
<li><p>The Third Party Store provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. Plankton Labs is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed.

</ol>

<p>In the event of a conflict between a Third Party Store’s or mobile carrier’s applicable terms and conditions and these Terms, the terms and conditions of the Third Party Store or mobile carrier shall govern and control. We are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever for third-party goods or services you obtain through a Third Party Store or mobile carrier. We encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online transaction with any of these third parties.</p>

<h2>10. TERMINATION AND REMEDIES</h2>

<p>These Terms commence on the date you accept them (as described in the preamble) and continue until terminated in accordance with the terms herein.</p>

<p>If you want to terminate these Terms, you may do so by closing your Account.</p>

<p>Plankton Labs may terminate or suspend these Terms, including your Account, if you breach these Terms or if Plankton Labs is required to do so by applicable law. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Plankton Labs’ sole discretion and that Plankton Labs shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.</p>

<p>In the event that Plankton Labs determines, in its sole discretion, that you have breached any portion of these Terms, or have otherwise demonstrated conducted inappropriate for the App, Plankton Labs reserves the right to: (a) warn you via email (to any email addresses you have provided to Plankton Labs) that you have violated the Terms; (b) delete your User Content; (c) discontinue your Account; (d) discontinue your subscription(s); (e) notify and/or send your User Content to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for further action; and/or (f) pursue to any other action which Plankton Labs deems to be appropriate.</p>

<p>All provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the Arbitration Agreement, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability.</p>

<h2>11. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

<p>These Terms, which we may amend from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and Plankton Labs. The Terms supersede all previous agreements, representations and arrangements between us (written or oral), excluding the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Plankton Labs has taken reasonable steps to ensure the currency, availability, correctness and completeness of the information contained on Plankton and provides that information on an "as is", "as available" basis.

If we do this then the Changes will be posted on this page and we will indicate the Effective Date of the updates at the bottom of the Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you of a Change. It’s also possible that we might ask you to agree to our Changes, but we’ll let you know. You should regularly check this page for notice of any Changes – we want our users to be as informed as possible.</p>

<p>Your continued use of Plankton following any Change constitutes your acceptance of the Change and you will be legally bound by the new updated Terms. If you do not accept any Changes to the Terms, you should stop using Plankton immediately.</p>

<h3>Additional items:</h3>

<p>If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.</p>

<p>No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the Terms and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of the right or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.</p>
