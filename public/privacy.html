<h1>Plankton Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This document explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your 
information, and with whom we share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction 
with our <a href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst you’re using the Plankton App (“App”), our websites and microsites 
(such as plankton-labs.com) (referred to in this Privacy Policy as our “Sites”), 
we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the 
App or Sites to share information with other users, including your friends and 
contacts (“Users”). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>

<p>The App and Sites are global, and your information will be sent to and used in 
the United States and the UK regardless of the country you reside in. This 
Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, 
so please read very carefully!</p>

<p><em>Who we are</em></p>

<p>The App and Sites are operated by the “Plankton Labs” (also referred to in this 
policy as “we” or “us”) which are controllers of personal information collected 
and processed through the App and Sites.</p>

<h2>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

<h3>Registration Information</h3>

</ul>

<p>Once you register, you will be able to review and change this information at 
any time just by logging in to Plankton. It is your responsibility to ensure 
that your account details are kept up to date.</p>

<p>The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users.
Registration Information such as your sexual preference, name may
be visible to other Users who view your profile page.</p>

following categories of “personal information”, as defined by the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>

<li>Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law,
such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial
information; </li>
<li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal
law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital
status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and
medical conditions; </li>
<li>Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase
history; </li>
<li>Biometric information (not relevant here);</li>

the unique device identifier, device model, operating system, and MAC address, 
for a number of purposes, as set out in this policy.</p>

on.</p>

<p>We will receive your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as
the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records
of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from
you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for 6 years after
deletion of your account.</p>

<h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>

This may include preserving or disclosing any of your information, including your Registration Information, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues e.g. through anti-spam providers to protect the service from criminal activity or to protect our rights or property or those of third parties.

<p><em>Plankton does not sell your data and has not sold your personal data in the

<h3>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURES</h3>

<h4>Sharing your personal data with Service Providers</h4>

<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide
services to us (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which Plankton shares
User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our
App, Sites and services a User engages with. For example, to provide our
services to Users, we typically use the following suppliers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Billing services – to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App
(for example, Google Play)</li>
<li>Authentication services – to allow customers to authenticate their account
(for example, Firebase Authenticator)</li>
<li>Social media providers – to allow customers to create/connect their Facebook
account with their account(s) on such platforms(for example Facebook, 
Instagram or Spotify)</li>
</ul>

<p>We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they
have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and
only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are
providing. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable
to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also subject to extensive
obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention
limits.</p>

<h2>4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU</h2>

<p>When using the Plankton App, you should assume that anything you post or submit
on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users
of the App. We want our Users to be careful about posting information that may
eventually be made public.</p>

<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile
such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may
voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, 
including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so.
Please remember that photographs that you post on Plankton may reveal
information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us
sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our
processing of this information and making it public to other Users.</p>

<p>Your Plankton profile and other information you make available via the App, 
including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts
(such as Facebook, Instagram or Spotify – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy
for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with
individuals who may or may not be users of the App. For example, a User may
recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot
of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is
also a User of the App.</p>

<p>If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another
third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out
of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in
order to prevent other users from accessing your Plankton account.</p>

<h2>5. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE</h2>

<p>Plankton does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, 
minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we
request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a
child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided
us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s
registration.</p>

<h2>6. SECURITY</h2>

<p>We pride ourselves on taking all appropriate security measures to help protect
your information against loss, misuse and unauthorised access, or disclosure.
We use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your
personal information such as secured servers using firewalls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100%
secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data
loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help
keep your data secure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know
who may stumble onto your Account!</li>
<li>Please don’t share the password you use to access your Plankton Account
with anyone else!</li>
<li>Change your password periodically.</li>
</ol>

<p>We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being
transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>7. Using your social media details to sign in to Plankton</h2>

<p>When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to
Facebook to share with us your name, email and profile picture.</p>

<p>We will then use this personal data to form your Plankton account. If you remove
the Plankton app from your Facebook settings we will no longer have access to
this data. However, we will still have the personal data that we received when 
ou first set up your Plankton account using your Facebook (you must delete your 
lankton account entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).</p>

<h2>8. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

<p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in
addition to those listed at section 10 below) under the California Consumer
Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for
exercising your rights under the Act:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you
and explain how we have collected, used and shared your personal information
over the past 12 months.</li>
<li>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that
we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
</ol>

<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain
businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the
businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third
parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find
out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, 
you can write to us at feedback@plankton-labs.com.</p>

<p>From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we may, 
if you participate in such promotion, disclose your contact information to the
third party to allow them to market their products or services to you. Where
this is a condition for participation in a promotion, we will always let you 
know before when you enter the promotion. Please follow the instructions
provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.</p>

<p>In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to
disclose how they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms
that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection
of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online
services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, 
we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across third-party
online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose
whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online 
ctivities over time and across different online services when the users use the
operator’s service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal
information about an individual User’s online activities over time and across
different online services when using the App.</p>

<h2>9. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

<p>Privacy laws applicable in your country may give you the following rights:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right to be informed: what personal data an organisation is processing and
why (we provide this information to you in this Privacy Policy).</li>
<li>Right of access: you can request a copy of your data.</li>
<li>Right of rectification: if the data held is inaccurate, you have the right
to have it corrected.</li>
<li>Right to erasure: you have the right to have your data deleted in certain
circumstances.</li>
<li>Right to restrict processing: in limited circumstances, you have the right
to request that processing is stopped but the data retained.</li>
<li>Right to data portability: you can request a copy of certain data in a
machine-readable form that can be transferred to another provider.</li>
<li>Right to object: in certain circumstances (including where data is
processed on the basis of legitimate interests or for the purposes of
marketing) you may object to that processing.</li>
<li>Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling: there are
several rights in this area where processing carried out on a solely automated
basis results in a decision which has legal or significant effects for the
individual. In these circumstances your rights include the right to ensure
that there is human intervention in the decision-making process.</li>
</ol>

<p>The particular rights which are applicable to you (which might include other
rights not listed above) may vary depending on your country. You should make
yourself aware of the rights you have under applicable privacy laws in your
country.</p>

<p>If you feel we have not resolved your concern, you have the right to make a
complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK
supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). If you live
in a country or territory located in the European Union (EU) or European
Economic Area (EEA), you may also get in touch with your local Data Protection
Regulator. If you live in a country outside the EU, you may have the right to
lodge a complaint with your local privacy or data protection regulator.</p>

<h2>10. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION</h2>

<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal
basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable
law.</p>

<p>When you delete your Account, or it is deactivated by us, we make sure it is no
longer viewable in the App, this may take times to propagate to all the users
of the app that have visibility to "Your Contents". We will delete your
personal information from our systems, unless:</p>

<ol>
<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make
purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept for tax and
accounting purposes); </li>
<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information and a
record of the behaviour that led to the block - this information is retained
for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims concerning the
block); </li>
<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the
relevant information until it is resolved; or</li>
<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such
as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security (for example, 
information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe
behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your
Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the
extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or
stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for
this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your
personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted
under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>

<h2>11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>

<p>As Plankton evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information
and will always be at plankton-labs.com/privacy-policy. If we make a change to
this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, 
for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by
posting a notice within Plankton.</p>
